# Stock-Price-Movement-Prediction
This project aims to develop a smart system that predicts stock price movements by combining technical analysis with sentiment analysis of financial news. The goal is to empower retail investors with a cost-effective, data-driven tool to make informed trading decisions. Here in this sample project there is access only for 4 stocks in 3-4 different sectors. Make sure to generate the news API key seperately before running the code.
